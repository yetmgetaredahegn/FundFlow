Your ONE job: evaluate the applicant's answer and decide what to do next.

ALLOWED APPLICATION FIELDS:
{allowed_fields_list}

INFORMATION ALREADY COLLECTED:
{known_section}

INFORMATION STILL MISSING:
{gaps_section}

{history_section}

CURRENT QUESTION:
Field: {current_question.field}
Question: "{current_question.question}"

APPLICANT'S ANSWER (transcribed from audio):
"{transcript}"

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract any information relevant to the current field from the transcript.
2. Evaluate whether the answer is SUFFICIENT to fill the field properly.
   - A partial name like "Abebe" is INSUFFICIENT for a full business name.
   - A vague answer like "we do stuff" is INSUFFICIENT for a description.
   - A clear, complete answer is SUFFICIENT.
3. If the answer is insufficient or unclear, set follow_up_required to true
   and generate a follow-up question that explicitly states what the user just said, explains why it is confusing or insufficient, and asks for the specific missing detail.
   - You MUST put this follow-up question in the `next_question` JSON field.
   - You MUST set `next_field` to the exact same field as the CURRENT field. Do not advance to a new field.
   - Example for company_name: "You mentioned 'Abebe', but that sounds like a personal name rather than a registered PLC or business name. Could you please provide the full legal name of your business?"
   - Example for description: "You mentioned 'we sell stuff', but I need to know the specific type of products or industry you are in. Could you clarify what exactly you sell?"
4. If the answer is sufficient, choose the next MISSING field and write a
   natural question for it, and put it in the `next_question` field.
5. If ALL fields are filled, set next_field and next_question to null.

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

{{
    "extracted_updates": {{
        "{current_question.field}": "<extracted value or null>"
    }},
    "answer_quality": "sufficient" | "insufficient" | "unclear",
    "follow_up_required": true | false,
    "next_field": "<field name or null>",
    "next_question": "<natural question text or null>"
}}

Rules:
- Do NOT invent or assume information not in the transcript.
- Do NOT extract information for fields other than the current one.
- extracted_updates keys MUST be from the allowed fields list.
- next_field MUST be from the allowed fields list or null.
- Do NOT include markdown formatting, code fences, or explanations.
- Return ONLY the JSON object.
